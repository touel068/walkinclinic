# Deliverable 5

Your group will have exactly 15 minutes for presenting your work (including setup time).

## Plagiarism notice

As discussed in tutorials, you should absolutely refrain from copying entire blocks of code from the internet. Note what was mentioned in the project description at the beginning of the semester:

"Students are encouraged to use the available toolset in android studio but should refrain from copying whole blocks of code from the internet to implement features. Should a group want to use a non-standard tool/API they should request permission before doing so."

You donâ€™t want your hard work in this course to be lost because of this. Code plagiarism might lead to you failing the course.

## Structure
It is recommended that you train for your presentation and divide your allotted time as
follows:

* 2 minutes for setup,
* 8 minutes to present your work,
* 5 minutes for questions from your TA.

The TA will cut you off at 15 minutes, and the next group will _begin_.

All members of your team _should_ be present, only if no timeslot
(any of the labs, or tutorial time) absolutely do not work will we will
allow teams to present _twice_.  You must show the TA your schedule
to receive such an exemption, and then you are alotted 10 minutes for each presentation.

## Appproach

Divide the presentation time among group members.

Let every group member talk about the parts of the application he/she worked on.

Do not expect the TA to guide you on what you should say during your presentation.

You are responsible for showing and explaining everything you did during your presentation time.

Since this might be the first presentation you perform at the University, it is strongly recommended
that you invest some time on preparing a comprehensive, well structured presentation of your work.

Questions from the TA should be answered by the group member who did the part the TA is asking about.

## Marking Scheme

| Feature or Task | Weight (/100 + 15 bonus) |
| --- | --- |
| 3 user types implemented (admin, clinic, patient) | 30 |
| Can create new service types | 5 |
| At least 8 service types included | 8 |
| A rate is associated with every service | 8 |
| Clinics can associate their accounts with one or more services | 5 |
| Clinics can set their working hours | 10 |
| Patients can search for a clinic | 5 |
| Patients can check in or book an appointment with a clinic | 9 |
| Application shows approximate waiting time based on number of people waiting  | 10 |
| Preparation, clarity, and work distribution, all members present | 10 |
| BONUS: Patients can search for a specific clinic | 10 |
| BONUS: Useful additional features | 5 |

The TA might ask you to create new accounts

There was some inconsistencies between the PDF and GitHub, so variations
on the specific attributes (hourly rate, etc) will not be penalized.

### Note

3 user types implemented has the highest weight because it includes whether or not your
application has separation of tasks (only admin can create new services, only clinics can set opening hours, only patients can check in/book an appointment) with 10 marks for each user type.

## Feedback

The TA will give comments and suggestions about your work.

It is recommended that you take them into consideration and improve on them before your final submission.

The grading of your submission will take into consideration the noted comments of the TA and how
you improved your work based on those comments.
