# Deliverable 3

## Feature Branch

Before starting this work, ensure that you have merged in your `f/deliverable02`
feature branch.

Now it's time to work on deliverable 3.

Make sure `master` has the latest and greatest code.
(Do not blindly follow these instructions, professor and TA not responsible for lost work)

```
git fetch
git checkout master
git reset --hard origin/master # <---- THIS WILL OVERWRITE LOCAL WORK
```

Ok, now the first contribute can create the branch using

```
git checkout -b f/deliverable03
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Other contributors will need to checkout that new branch

```
git fetch
git checkout f/deliverable03
```

Please consider using feature branches for individual work and using
pull requests back into `f/deliverable03` as a workflow to coordinate
between team members.  Make them SMALL, focused and merge them often.

## Initial requirements

The user of the app must be able to sign-in as service provider.
The following features outlined below and in the marking scheme should only be present for the service provider.

### Managing Profile Information

The process of completing the service provider's profile information includes:

* Enter address (mandatory field) and phone number (mandatory field)
* Name of the clinic (mandatory field)
* Insurance types (mandatory field)
* Payment methods accepted (mandatory field).

The description used to refer to 

* General description and Licensed (Yes/No), both will be accepted in lieu of Insurance types and payment methods.

The fields above need to be included, and `mandatory field` means that the user must specify a value.

You can include additional fields you find necessary.

### Managing Clinic Working Hours

You are free to implement this feature as you want.

The clinic user should be able to create/edit/update/delete their availability,
as well as view their own availability.

For example:

```
Clinic is available during the following times:
- Monday 9h00-12h00
- Tuesday 9h00-14h00
- Friday 6h00-12h00
```

Usability is key for this feature!

Your marks for this feature will be split between

* Creating (20)
* Viewing (10)
* Editing (BONUS +10)

## Building Your APK

For more info: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/

* Go to `Build` -> `Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)` > `Build APK(s)`
* Android Studio saves the APKs you build in `project-name/module-name/build/outputs/apk/`
* Use the `_Debug` one for submission.

## Submission

You can install [Hub](https://github.com/github/hub)
a command line tool to create pull requests
